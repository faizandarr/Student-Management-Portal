# Student Management Portal

A comprehensive Student Management System developed as a semester project for the Database Systems course (CS2005) at FAST NUCES, Islamabad.

## Project Overview

The **Student Management Portal** is an academic database management system modeled after FAST NUCES' internal FLEX portal. It handles course management, student enrollment, academic operations, and reporting for three core user roles:

- **Academic Office**
- **Faculty**
- **Students**

This system ensures data integrity, user-specific privileges, and report generation with a secure and scalable backend.

## Database Schema

The project uses Microsoft SQL Server and follows a normalized relational model. Major tables include:

- `users`: Student, Faculty, Academic Office metadata
- `course`: Course details with pre-requisites
- `attendance`: Attendance records for each lecture
- `marks`: Evaluations with statistical metrics
- `feedback`: Feedback per student-teacher-course
- `student_grade`, `transcript`: Academic performance data
- `semester`, `degree`, `section`: Structural data

The schema is defined in [`query.sql`](query.sql).
